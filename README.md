## Overview

You've struggled to decide where you and your friends or partner want to eat. 'What We Eatin?' is the perfect solution for it! With this app you will be able to enter a zip-code and instantly receive 15 restaurants to then vote on. The best part about this app is only one person from the group needs to have access to it. Friends, partners, & family will be able to vote for restaurants and make a decision within minutes!

## Features

When a user opens the app, they will be able to search for the nearest restaurants by submiting a Zip Code. They will then be able to select ONLY _three_ restaurants options that their friends can vote on. After submiting three restaurants options, they will be able to send the link to their friends to start the voting and tallying!
